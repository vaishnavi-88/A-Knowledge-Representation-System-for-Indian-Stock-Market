<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>Investors at well-known firms are increasingly interested in stock forecasting as they look 
for more effective methods to make market predictions using behavioral finance tools. Accordingly, 
studies aimed at predicting the performance of stocks are gaining popularity in both academic and 
business circles. This research aims to develop a knowledge graph-based model for forecasting stock 
price movement using fundamental ratios of well-known corporations in India. This paper uses the 
data of 15 ratios taken from the top 50 companies according to market capitalization in India. The 
data is processed, and using different algorithms, a knowledge representation system is computed, 
resulting in a knowledge graph. </p>
<b>Keywords : Artificial Intelligence, Stock Market, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Fundamental Analysis</b>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Formal concept analysis is a method of data analysis which deals with object-attribute input data and aims at extracting from the data conceptual clusters also called formal concepts and data dependencies.

It acquires groupings, called formal concepts, from Boolean data named context, comprising of objects and attributes.
